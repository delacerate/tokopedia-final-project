# final-project-gigih

Welcome to the documentation for the "final-project-gigih." This project aims to [briefly describe the purpose of the project]. While the documentation is still a work in progress, we're excited to share insights into the frontend and backend components.

## Note

**Apologies:** If this documentation is still incomplete, it's due to my recent health condition, busy schedule, and lack of time management. These circumstances have required me to stay in the hospital for a few days. Many features are incomplete, and the code may be messy. I intend to rectify these issues in the near future.

Thank you for your understanding.
